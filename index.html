				Covid-19– Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases. A novel coronavirus (nCoV) is a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans..<br>
				What is the meaning of COVID-19?
               COVID-19 is a disease caused by a new strain of coronavirus. 'CO' stands for corona, 'VI' for virus, and 'D' for disease. Formerly, this disease was referred to as '2019 novel coronavirus' or '2019-nCoV.'<br>

				What Is a COVID-19 Variant?<br>
				Viruses are always changing, and that can cause a new variant, or strain, of a virus to form. A variant usually doesn’t affect how the virus works. But sometimes they make it act in different ways.
               Scientists around the world are tracking changes in the virus that causes COVID-19. Their research is helping experts understand whether certain COVID variants spread faster than others, how they might affect your health, and how effective different vaccines might be against them.</p>

				Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.

Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.

The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face. 

The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).

								Traditional remedies<b><br>
There are many natural 'cures' and herbal remedy ideas floating around the internet and in health stores. Currently, we aren't aware of any remedy to cure COVID-19, so don't be fooled by the 'miracle' treatments some people are trying to sell.<br>

On October 22, 2020, <b>the FDATrusted Source approved its first COVID-19 treatment, the medication remdesivir (Veklury). It’s available by prescription to treat COVID-19 in people ages 12 years and older who’ve been hospitalized. It’s administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion.

In November 2020, the FDA also granted EUAs to monoclonal antibody medications.

Monoclonal antibodies are human-made proteins that help the body develop an immune response against foreign-made substances such as viruses.

Most COVID-19 treatment focuses on managing symptoms as the virus runs its course.

Seek medical help if you think you have COVID-19. Your doctor will recommend treatment for any symptoms or complications that develop and let you know if you need to seek emergency treatment.
Examples of therapies used for these illnesses include:

antiviral or retroviral medications
breathing support, such as mechanical ventilation
steroids to help reduce lung swelling and inflammation
blood plasma transfusions </p>
